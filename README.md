# dites
Repo for the dites project

This is a web site created with python and flask that serves catalan dites. 
Each day, it provides a dita according to the day (Sant Jordi, Santa Ll√∫cia...) or period (Winter, Summer...).

There is "another dita" that is not tied to the period. And finally, a search button.
